A common problem with boilerplates is that they are built for people who already understand what all the pieces do. This boilerplate is barebones by design to provide a simpler environment for learning.

## How to Use

### Installation

Clone the repo to a local directory and run either `yarn` or `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.

### Run the Dev Server

The commands `yarn start` or `npm start` will run the start script. This script will start an instance of the Webpack dev server hosting this project. You can then navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in a web browser.

## Other Recommendations

Personally, I would recommend using `yarn` and I've included the `yarn.lock` file for this project though you can use `npm` instead and be just fine.
